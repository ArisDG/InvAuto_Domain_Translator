PyTorch implementation based on the paper "[Invertible Autoencoder for Domain Adaptation](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/7/2/20/htm)"

In order to run: 
1. Download Road Data from [KAIST](https://soonminhwang.github.io/rgbt-ped-detection/ "Download speeds are horrible, look for the OneDrive Link") Dataset (set01.zip and set04.zip), 
2. Extract and put images from the visible subfolders to  ```data/day/``` and ```data/night/``` folders respectively
